After having missed the [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/) on 9th of April, I'm happy to be able to participate to the [JS Naked Day](https://js-naked-day.org/).  
My website is not yet ready to work without CSS.
All images miss static size tags and everything is messed up and not working.
So hopefully next year it could be ready.

# NO JS
My main goal for this website is to have no JS at all, never.
So I had nothing to do for JS Naked Day, just write this blog post.
