Github Actions allow you to automate repetitive tasks, like exporting your game for iOS and uploading it to the App Store.
It also brings the advantage that you don't need a Mac at all. So it saves you time and money, if you're not a Mac user.  
I'm using the action already in my Godot games like [Pocket Broomball](/games/pocket-broomball) or [Ball2Box](/games/ball2box).  
You can find the action and instructions here on [Github](https://github.com/dulvui/godot-ios-upload).

If you have problems or need help with the action simply open an issue in the repository.
