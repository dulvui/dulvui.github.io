I create now games since 2018 and here I want to share my experience with [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
In total I currently created 3 games in libGDX and 2 with Godot for Android and iOS.  

## libGDX
LibGDX is a simple but powerful Java library for cross platform game development.  
You need to code everything in Java and there's no Editor like you get with Godot.
So, you can use your favorite Java IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, Android Studio or whatever you prefer.
This makes libGDX really powerful because it lets you control and define every aspect of your game.
From loading the assets, to freeing the memory and positioning the button is done by you and by pure code.
No automatic memory management or UI help.

## Final thoughts
If you know Java well and you want to take completely control of your game, then libGDX is perfect for you.
But if you like fast development, create your UI by mouse dragging and clicking, you should go for Godot.
Both are powerful tools to create games.
