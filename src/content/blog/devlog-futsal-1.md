With this blog post I (hopefully) will start a long series of devlogs about my game development.
This devlog will focus on the game I'm currently working on: [Futsal Manager](@/games/futsal-manager/index.md).

About 10 people wrote me already an e-mail, asking mainly about when the game will be released and which teams the game will inlcude.
It is amazing to see that people care about the game, already before any game is available.
This motivates me a lot and pushes me really to finish this game.

## FAQ
So here a quick answer to the frequently asked questions:

### When will the game be avaiable?
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope to release a first playable demo version on itch.io and then on Steam
I started working on the game on 11th July 2020 and a lot happened since then.
I migrated it from Godot 3.5 to 4, rewrote the Match engine several times and

### On which platform will the game support?
This will be my first Desktop game released on Steam.
So it will be available for **Linux** and **Windows**.
If have no experience with bulding Godot games for MacOS, but once the main platforms are supported, I will take a look into that.

For now no (official) mobile release is planned, since it is quite difficult to fit the content on small screens with touch support.
There is already an apk file avaiable to Download for Android on Github and this will continute to be available.
But in my experience maintaining mobile games is something I don't want to handle for now.
