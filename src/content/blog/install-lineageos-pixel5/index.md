I just bought a refurbished Pixel 5 to upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S5.
The Samsung is still getting updates on [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/) 18.1 and working fine for simple tasks, but I felt that it is time to change phone.
I looked for a while what phone I should buy, since I want a compact phone, so there are not many options.
A must have is Lineage OS 20 support, so I found this awesome page [lineageosdevices.com](https://lineageosdevices.com/) where you can compare devices that can run the latest version.
So I found the Pixel 5, that is quite new and small.  
The install process was not as simple as I taught, since I made some mistakes.
So here I will share what I did wrong and how to fix eventual boot loops or other problems I faced.

# Read the docs, really do it.
Read carefully the official guide https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/redfin/install
It will prevent a lot of mistakes and if I would have read it more carefully,
