In this post I would like to show **what impact** open sourcing my games had and **why** you should consider open sourcing your game too.

I already presented what effect F-Droid had on my games at [SFSCON 2023](@/blog/sfscon-2023-fdroid/index.md)

## More visibility

## Quality feedback
Getting feedback from users is quite hard.
Even harder is getting *good* feedback.

This will change drastically, when you open source your game.
Because more technical people will see your game 

## Better portfolio
Letting other people see your code could be intimidating to some.
They might feel their code has not a good enough or feel afraid of critics.
Don't worry, nobody will point fingers at you or comparing your code with the Linux Kernel code.

But whenever you want to show what you have done, being able to show your source code and the ability to use git and write some minimal documentation, might come rally handy.
So landing a new job or landing a project as freelancer, will be easier with a active [enter your favorite git platform] profile.  

This applies to any software related work, not only games.

## Licenses
I won't get to deep into licenses, since it is a complex subject and I'm not a lawyer.  
But here I want to share my experience and knowledge with you. 
It is important to know that **code** and **assets** probably will have different type of licenses.
The most common software licenses are GPL or MIT and for assets the mostly used licenses are Creative Commons license as the CC0, CC-BY or CC-BY-SA.
Here you can find a tool by creative commons to find a license for your assets that fits your needs https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org

I chose the copyleft AGPL-v3-or-later for my code and CC-BY-SA-4.0 for my assets.
This are copyleft licenses, that means tha you are free to study, use, modify, share and all deviates keep the same license.
The AGPL has a special clause about distributing code over network.
So technically if a cloud gaming provider wants to distrubute my games, he would have to share the code.
This would not be required with the GPL-v3 license.
But as said before, I'm not a lawyer and this are my personal thoughts.
Do your research or get a lawyers advice, if needed.

Some might prefer permissive licenses as MIT and CC-BY-3.0
This licenses give the user the same rights, but don't require sharing the modified code when distributed.
That means that someone might simply take your game, modify and release it, without having to show the modifications.

Choose wisely.
