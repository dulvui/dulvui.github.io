The main target of the Godot Engine is of course creating games.
It's easy workflow and awesome UI elements makes it also to create non-game applications.
There are already some out there you may know, like [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama), an Open Source 2D sprite editor.  

## Condor
Recently I also started creating a an application made with Godot Engine, named "Condor".
A mobile and desktop app for managing the Italian Fantasy Football "Fantacalcio" auction.
The name derives from the nickname "il condor" of [Adriano Galliani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriano_Galliani).
He gained the name by his strategy of buying football players the last hours of the transfer market, to get better conditions, because teams want to get rid of some players they where not able to sell yet.

There are already some apps out there, but non is Open Source and available for Linux, without ads and tracking.
You can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/dulvui/condor) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/dulvui/condor) as usual.

## So far so good
For now I really enjoy creating apps with the Godot Engine, since it is really easy to create complex UI's fast.

## Release date
This year I will use the app only internally for my own Fantacalcio league, but I plan to release it to the public for the next season.
